# CASA0006 Data-Science-for-Spatial-Systems Assessment



When it comes to predicting house prices in Philadelphia, the student not only looked at the usual features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.. the safety, amenities and convenience of the houses was also accounted for using distance from defined features - making it interesting to read. However the graffiti distance plot had no legend so I assumed that the darker colour is the shortest distance, so this was confusing as well as the background being similar to the darkest colour in the Viridis palette, the student could have made missing data & background white to solve the problem. Good use of correlation, however this does not explain multicollinearity as stated - for that you need to use VIF for multicollinearity or look at the p-values in the model to improve it by selecting significant coefficients. Overall it was a very tidy notebook and interesting to read.
